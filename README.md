# Marker

Marker is a personal project with two purposes.

- Playing around with Symfony and TDD
- Creating a CMS/blog based on markdown files

I know there is a lot of projects doing the same, and for now, this is only meant to be for me, but feel free to play around with it if you want.

If you need a stable and well known system, I can recommend looking into [Grav](https://getgrav.org).

## Future plans (TODO)

- Basic layout
- Convert to composer package
