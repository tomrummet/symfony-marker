# Personal website running Marker

Marker is a personal project with two purposes.

- Playing around with Symfony and TDD
- Creating a CMS/blog based on markdown files

I know there is a lot of projects doing the same, and for now, this is only meant to be for me, but feel free to play around with it if you want.

If you need a stable and well known system, I can recommend looking into [Grav](https://getgrav.org).

This repository is meant for being the repository for my website/blog.

## Future plans (TODO)

- Move Marker to own repository and composer package
- Layoyt/styling for website (minimal)
